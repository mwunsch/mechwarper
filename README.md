# Mechwarper

Studies in configuration management and provisioning. The purpose of
this repository is to house scripts for administering my personal
systems and to better understand the _Infrastructure as Code_ process.

Currently focusing on writing [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com)
playbooks for a single [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org) server hosted
on [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/19d9dc066fc3).
